The project entails building a responsive website that showcases upcoming and recommended events. It leverages APIs to fetch event data and presents it in a visually appealing manner. The website has two main sections: recommended events and upcoming events.

These events are fetched from a specific API endpoint. Each event entry includes details such as event name, location, date, weather forecast, distance, and a thumbnail image.

The upcoming events section displays multiple events vertically. To ensure efficient loading, events are fetched page by page from the provided API endpoint. A loading spinner indicates when the next page is being retrieved.
